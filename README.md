## 🔍 Info

### ⚠️ NOTICE ⚠️
> FTLL is approaching a solid beta release, there is still a bit to be done to make
sure that things will be running smoothly in the future. This mostly has to do with
moving over to the full Tauri release, its in RC now, so hopefully soon! <3

FTLL is a simple and small mod launcher & manager for DayZ, built with Rust,
[Tauri](https://tauri.app), React and modern tools. Completely open-source and
always will be. FTLL uses your systems native web-view to render a beautiful UI,
which lets us keep our bundle size extremely small. *Blazing* fast caching and loading
of the most popular servers in the DayZ community. Try it out!

Although this project *was* built with Linux compatability in mind, I don't have
a Linux machine to test that, and disabling secure boot to dualboot Linux is a
non-starter. *Theoretically*, Tauri provides us with everything we need to push
a build out for Linux, but the difference in packaging amongst all the dozens
of distributions makes it a nightmare for a small developer.

### Features
- Playerlists for connected servers
- Accurate player counts
- *Blazing* fast Rust based server caching
- Intuitive UI
- Multithreaded server updating
- Open source
- And much more!
